# responsiveLettering

Responsive lettering: scalable, interpolating vector shapes that can make themselves fit in a range of rectangles.
<a href="http://letterror.com/dev/mathshapes/">More examples here.</a>

The python code consists of a couple of scripts to generate the SVG needed for responsive lettering. Somehow these compile into a RoboFontExtension, but that probably needs to be fixed.

The www/ folder contains a working example. As it is loading .js and .json files it might be necessary to serve the files from a real server. When everything works it should look something like <a href="http://letterror.com/dev/public/index.html">this</a>.

Ideas and code very much in debt to Jeremie Hornus, Nina Stössinger, Andrew Johnson, Onur Yazıcıgil, and Nick Sherman.
